A deep learning project that classifies surface-level metal defects using image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on labeled defect images and is capable of identifying six different types of surface anomalies found in industrial steel components.

Project Description
This project aims to automate the detection of metal surface defects by training a supervised image classification model. The model learns from a dataset containing images of six defect categories‚ÄîCrazing, Inclusion, Patches, Pitted Surface, Rolled-in Scale, and Scratches‚Äîand predicts the defect present in new image inputs with high accuracy. The model was built using CNN layers for feature extraction and trained using the Keras framework.
