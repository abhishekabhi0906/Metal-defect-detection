This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect and classify surface-level defects in metal components from image data. The goal is to streamline quality control in industrial manufacturing by replacing manual inspection with an intelligent deep learning model.

Project Overview
This project involves training a supervised deep learning model using Keras to detect six types of surface defects on steel: crazing, inclusion, patches, pitted surface, rolled-in scale, and scratches. The model was trained on labeled images and achieved high classification accuracy, allowing for real-time defect prediction on new input images.

Key Features:
Preprocessing of image data (resizing, normalization, label encoding)
CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers
High accuracy (~98%) on validation dataset
Real-time inference using custom input image
Scalability for deployment in quality control systems

Model Architecture :
Input Layer: 200x200x3 RGB images
Multiple Conv2D + ReLU layers
MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction
Dropout for regularization
Fully connected Dense layers with softmax output

Dataset:
6 defect categories from NEU Metal Surface Defects Dataset
Images split into training and validation sets
Preprocessed using Kerasâ€™ ImageDataGenerator

Tech Stack :
Python
Keras & TensorFlow
NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib & Seaborn
OpenCV (for preprocessing)
Jupyter Notebook

Results :
Confusion matrix and classification report available in notebook
Validation Accuracy: ~98%
Model successfully detects and classifies defects on unseen image inputs.
Real-time prediction on new images implemented via a simple inference script.
